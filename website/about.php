			<h3><b>Site Design</b></h3>
			
			<p>I noticed throughout the 2017-2018 college basketball season that my favorite team seemed to be beating the spread an awful lot. I wondered, was this just confirmation bias? Just how well was my team doing compared to others? It seemed like nobody expected my team to be able to dominate, yet dominate we did (until we didn't, in a tragic March Madness loss).</p>
			
			<p>This site was a way to test that question, while also developing my skills in web scraping, light data manipulation/analysis in Python, web development using modern toolkits (such as UIKit or Bootstrap), and eventually data visualization.</p>
